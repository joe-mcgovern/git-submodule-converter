# Submodule converter

This script was created because I had `git clone`d all my vim packages and
was wanting to store my entire vim structure in source control. Git doesn't
play nicely with embedded git repositories. So, I wrote this script to convert
my embedded git repositories to submodules.

Usage:

```
python /path/to/submodule_converter.py
```
